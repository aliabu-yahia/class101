### The while statement creates a loop that is executed while a specified condition is true.

### The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will **only stop** when the condition becomes false.

### The if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.

### The if/else statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

#### In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

<ol>
<li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
<li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
<li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
</ol>
