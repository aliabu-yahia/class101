# The while statement creates a loop that is executed while a specified condition is true.

# The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false.

# The if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.

# The if/else statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
<li>
Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
<li>
