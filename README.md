# The growth mindset and fixed mindset
**The growth mindset** can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.

**The fixed mindset**, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

And in this table we show *some different* between them:

when faced with |challenges|obstacles
---------------|----------|---------
growth mindset |embraces |persists
fixed mindset |avoids |loses focus
